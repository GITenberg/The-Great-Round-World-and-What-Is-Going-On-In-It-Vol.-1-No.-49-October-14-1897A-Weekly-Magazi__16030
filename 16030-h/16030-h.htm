<p>There was a very disquieting rumor last week to the effect that England
had refused to take part in the Seal Conference.</p>

<p>The reason given for her refusal was that she could not join in the
discussion if Russia and Japan were admitted to it.</p>

<p>At the British Foreign Office, which is the department of the Government
that has the charge of such matters, the officials refused to say
positively whether Great Britain had declined to take part in the
conference, but they let it be understood that Canada was at the bottom
of the trouble.</p>

<p>The Canadian Government was most unwilling to have Great Britain join in
the conference, and asked that the mother country should withdraw, and
leave the settlement of the matter to the colony that was most
interested in it.</p>

<p>It was thought that Canada feared that Japan and Russia might look at
the sealing question from the same point of view that we do, and so
persuaded England to object to them, and thus draw out of the<a name="Page_1372" id="Page_1372"></a>
conference.</p>

<p>That England should say she would not join because of Russia and Japan,
was a great surprise to the officials in Washington.</p>

<p>When Mr. Foster was in London last July, he told the British officials
that he had just returned from St. Petersburg, having obtained the
consent of the Czar to send a representative to the meeting. England
consenting to join the conference soon after this, it was thought that
the consent of the two other countries had influenced her to come to a
like decision.</p>

<p>In the same month of July, our ambassador in England wrote to Lord
Salisbury, told him of the arrangements that had been made, and asked
whether Great Britain would surely be represented.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister kept this note unanswered until September, and then
said he could not possibly take part in any discussion to which Japan
and Russia were also to be admitted.</p>

<p>Every one wondered what this refusal could mean, and it caused a very
bad impression, as it came right after the publication by the Foreign
Office of a book in which the letters and despatches which had passed
between the two countries in the seal dispute had been printed.</p>

<p>This book contained some very unfriendly remarks about the United
States. Among other things it was said that we ought not to be making
such a fuss about the kind of sealing that is now being carried on,
because in 1832 we practised the same methods ourselves in the South
Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>This accusation is absolutely true, but Mr. Chamberlain, in his book,<a name="Page_1373" id="Page_1373"></a>
did not add that bitter experience in the south had taught us our
lesson, and that it is because of the destruction we had worked to the
southern herd that we are so anxious to take better care of the
northern.</p>

<p>So important does the protection of the seals seem to our Government,
that when the news came that England might not join in the conference if
Japan and Russia were represented there, it was decided to hold the
meeting, whether Great Britain joined or not. But, being anxious to keep
on the best of terms with our English cousins, the Government sent a
most pressing invitation to England, begging her to attend the
conference, and hear what the scientists had to say about the seal herd,
even if she would not take any part in the discussion.</p>

<p>In view of this, England has consented to attend the meetings, but will
not say whether she will take any part in the proceedings.</p>

<p>The English papers say they cannot see what interest the Russians and
Japanese have in the Bering Sea dispute. The United States is, however,
extremely anxious that these two countries should be at the meeting to
give their opinion about the proper manner and season in which to hunt
seals.</p>

<p>It is intended that several scientists who have studied the habits of
the seals shall appear before the members of the conference, and give
their views about the condition of the herd. Professor D'Arcy Thompson
for England, and Professor David Starr Jordan for America, will be among
the number.</p>

<p>Russian and Japanese experts are also to make statements on the subject;
but a report from Canada says that the Canadian representative intends<a name="Page_1374" id="Page_1374"></a>
to ask that these gentlemen shall not be allowed to speak, as she does
not think they are sufficiently well acquainted with the life and habits
of the seals to be able to offer an expert opinion.</p>

<p>Up to the moment of receiving Great Britain's refusal to treat with us,
every one supposed that it was only necessary to explain to England the
damage that was being done to the herd, for her to join us in making
arrangements to protect them.</p>

<p>Now every one is feeling uncertain what the result of the conference
will be.</p>

<p>We told you the cause of this difference of opinion between the two
countries was the careless and wasteful way in which the hunters have
killed the seals.</p>

<p>Instead of waiting till the animals have reached their feeding-grounds,
they have killed many in the open sea; this is called pelagic sealing,
and is against the law. In addition to this they have killed them in an
unlawful way at their feeding-grounds. Instead of separating and killing
the young bachelor seals, who are tiresome fellows, and hang round the
colonies annoying and fighting the father seals who are trying to bring
up their families, the sealers have entered the colonies or rookeries
themselves, and slaughtered the mothers, leaving hundreds and thousands
of motherless puppies behind to die for want of proper care (see p.
736).</p>

<p>Because of this the seal herd has been decreasing so rapidly that fear
has arisen that it will disappear if the seals are not properly cared
for.</p>

<p>The object of the conference is to decide whether the seal herd is
really decreasing, and if so, to make <a name="Page_1375" id="Page_1375"></a>strict laws to protect the mother
seals and their poor helpless little puppies.</p>

<p>A British war-ship, the <i>Wild Swan</i>, which is stationed in the Bering
Sea to protect the sealing interests of Great Britain, has just arrived
at Victoria, British Columbia.</p>

<p>The officers state that the seal herd is undoubtedly very much smaller
this year; so small indeed that there is the gravest reason to fear that
the seals are really dying out.</p>

<p>The Englishmen lay the blame of the smallness of the herd on the
shoulders of Professor Jordan, and declare that it is due to the
branding of the seals.</p>

<p>They insist that the seals who were branded last year were so badly
frightened that they will not venture into the same waters again.
Instead of coming to the Pribylov Islands, the officers say that they
have made their way to some other islands north of Japan, and that the
Japanese are reaping the benefit of Professor Jordan's experiment.</p>

<p>The British officers also say that the electric apparatus which Dr.
Jordan took with him this year has proved to be a failure, and that the
branding has had to be done with hot irons as usual. Trouble with the
apparatus caused considerable delay, and according to the story told by
the officers of the <i>Wild Swan</i>, only a few pups have been branded.</p>

<p>This news makes the conference all the more necessary. If there are no
means of marking the female seals without frightening the herd away from
their feeding-grounds, the different countries interested in the sealing
trade should lose no time in coming to an understanding, that the herd
may be preserved.<a name="Page_1376" id="Page_1376"></a></p>

<p>The Japanese and Russian representatives are already on their way here,
but the meeting cannot be held until the beginning of November, as Sir
Julian Pauncefote, who will attend the conference on behalf of England,
cannot arrive here before that time.</p>

<p>We shall, in all probability, gain much interesting information about
seals and seal life from this convention.</p>

<p>Several fresh meetings have been held in Athens to protest against the
treaty of peace with Turkey. It is said that the people are becoming
more violent, and are calling upon the King of Greece to continue the
war.</p>

<p>At one of the meetings the other day, angry things were said about the
King and the Crown Prince, the people blaming them for the unfortunate
results of the war.</p>

<p>The cabinet ministers and the more thoughtful people in Greece are,
however, of opinion that the best thing to be done is to bear, as best
they may, the burdens which it puts on the country.</p>

<p>The Russian Minister in Athens has laid the treaty officially before the
Greek minister of foreign affairs, and now all the necessary formalities
have been gone through, and it only remains for the Greek parliament to
accept or refuse the terms offered.</p>

<p>The Russian minister sent a note with the treaty, saying that the Sultan
considered the Powers had done all that they could to restore peace, and
he now waited for Greece to send her ministers to Constantinople to
arrange the final document which will bind <a name="Page_1377" id="Page_1377"></a>the two countries. The
Russian minister also stated that the Powers offered to assist at the
meetings, in case any fresh difficulties should arise.</p>

<p>You must not imagine from this that there are to be two treaties of
peace. There will of course be but one; however, lest you should be
confused as to how it is that the Powers, having arranged a treaty which
was signed by Turkey, are now conveying a message to Greece asking her
to send her ministers to arrange another treaty, it is best to explain
the matter to you.</p>

<p>The business of the Powers was to find out on what terms the Sultan was
willing to make peace with Greece. They had no right to promise that
Greece would accept the terms Turkey offered; they could only use their
influence to have the terms as easy as possible.</p>

<p>The terms of peace being agreed upon between the Sultan and the Powers,
they signed their names to the document, to show that they meant to keep
their promises.</p>

<p>The signing of this paper does not necessarily mean that the final
treaty of peace is to be exactly like it, but merely that the Sultan is
willing to agree that the frontier shall be laid out as has been agreed
upon with the Powers, the Greeks to pay not less than a certain sum, and
Thessaly to be evacuated (the Turkish troops withdrawn from it) not
later than a certain date.</p>

<p>On this basis Turkey and Greece will meet, and draw up the final treaty,
which both sovereigns will sign, and which will bind them to carry out
all it provides.</p>

<p>The Boul&eacute;, the Greek parliament, will have met in <a name="Page_1378" id="Page_1378"></a>a few days, and will
have to decide whether the terms offered by Turkey shall be accepted or
not.</p>

<p>It is reported that the Greek Government will resign. None of the
ministers wish to remain in power, and be held responsible for accepting
the treaty.</p>

<p>It is supposed that the Boul&eacute; will vote to accept the peace offer, and
that the excitement among the people will gradually die out. It would of
course be madness for King George to try and continue the war, because
he has neither soldiers, generals, nor the necessary money.</p>

<p>The Turkish people are as jubilant and happy as the Greeks are angry and
depressed.</p>

<p>It is openly said that the Sultan has been so successful about the peace
negotiations that there is very little doubt that he will be able to
arrange the matter of Crete in a manner that will be pleasing to all his
subjects.</p>

<p>This may be only idle talk, or it may be, as we told you last week, that
the Sultan does not intend to keep his word about Crete. It looks as if
the island, for which Greece sacrificed herself, will not get home rule
after all, but will be forced back into the old state of slavery from
which King George tried to rescue her.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>From India we hear the good news that the British forces have captured
the camp and village which formed the headquarters of the Haddah Mullah,
and that the Mullah had to flee before the approach of the English.<a name="Page_1379" id="Page_1379"></a></p>

<p>Some people think that this defeat of the Mullah will have the effect of
bringing the insurrection to a close, but it is as well not to put too
much faith in this idea. We had a report a few days ago that the
rebellion was over, and the very next week the British met with a severe
repulse.</p>

<p>It is certain that the capture of the Mullah's camp has had a good
effect on the natives.</p>

<p>The British were so confident that good results would follow it, that
they ordered a two-days' armistice; that is to say, they stopped
fighting the rebels for two days, to give them an opportunity to submit.</p>

<p>The Mohmands did take advantage of the chance offered them, and the
British think they are entirely subdued. The Afridis and Orakzais are,
however, as rebellious as ever.</p>

<p>These tribes refused to submit to the British, and instead sent
messengers to the Ameer of Afghanistan, asking him to help them.</p>

<p>They have spread a report among the hill tribes that the Ameer has asked
hostages from them, and will help them if the hostages are given.</p>

<p>A hostage is a person given and held under the laws of war, as a pledge.</p>

<p>For instance, if this report is true about the Ameer, it means that he
has asked that they shall give into his hands certain important leaders
of tribes, whose lives and liberty are very precious to the Afridis.
These people to be held by him until the war is over, as a guarantee
that he will receive his compensation for helping them to fight the
British.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="./images/10.png" alt="NATIVE SOLDIERS IN INDIA." title="NATIVE SOLDIERS IN INDIA." /></div>
<div class='center'>NATIVE SOLDIERS IN INDIA.</div>

<p>Hostages are always persons of high rank, and <a name="Page_1380" id="Page_1380"></a><a name="Page_1381" id="Page_1381"></a>persons whose lives are
so precious that their people will not allow them to be sacrificed.</p>

<p>The giving of hostages is therefore considered the most binding form of
agreement between savage peoples.</p>

<p>In this instance, however, the story that the Ameer demanded hostages
does not appear to be true.</p>

<p>A later despatch says that the messengers sent by the Afridis and
Orakzais were turned back at Jelalabad, and ordered to leave the
country.</p>

<p>The principal request they had to make of the Ameer was that he would
give them ammunition; bullets, gunpowder, and cartridges.</p>

<p>The fact that the Ameer sent them back without granting them an audience
has convinced the British that he is sincere in declaring himself
friendly to that nation.</p>

<p>The mullahs, or priests, have been persuading the people that the Ameer
would help them as soon as the revolution was firmly established. It is
these same mullahs who are responsible for the suspicions the English
had of the Ameer.</p>

<p>It is said that the tribesmen are just beginning to understand that the
Ameer does not mean to help them, and that they have only themselves to
look to, to support their rebellion against England.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>There is a report from Cuba that the Spaniards have reconquered the town
of Las Tunas. This, however, seems hard to believe. Only last week
reliable information was sent to us, that, owing to the impossibility of
sparing enough men to guard <a name="Page_1382" id="Page_1382"></a>the town, the Cubans had decided to destroy
it, and had accordingly burnt it to the ground.</p>

<p>The Carlists are daily assuming a more threatening attitude.</p>

<p>In the hope of quieting the people, who have become fearful lest a civil
war should break out, the Government spread a report that Don Carlos had
given up his claim to the throne of Spain, and that there was no fear
that he would cause any trouble.</p>

<p>Don Carlos, however, caused a letter to be published throughout Spain,
in which he denied the story, and said he was only waiting until the
proper time arrived to come forward. He added that one hundred thousand
volunteers were ready to take up arms for him at his call.</p>

<p>Side by side with this unwelcome announcement comes the news that there
is fresh trouble in the Spanish Cabinet.</p>

<p>Se&ntilde;or Reverter, the Spanish minister of finance, that is to say, the
minister who has charge of the money affairs of Spain, has been
excommunicated by the Church of Rome.</p>

<p>This minister has had a very hard battle to fight against the poverty of
his country, and her pressing need for money.</p>

<p>In his anxiety to help her he committed the unwarrantable act of seizing
money belonging to one of the churches, and using it for the Government.</p>

<p>The Church protested against this robbery, but the minister declared
that the Government must have the money she needed, and, in spite of the
indignation of the churchmen, proceeded to take it.</p>

<p>Finding that they could get no help from the Gov<a name="Page_1383" id="Page_1383"></a>ernment, the members of
the church appealed to the Bishop who had charge of the district in
which the plundered church was situated.</p>

<p>The anger of this bishop knew no bounds. He would not allow the Church
to be so shamefully robbed, and sent an angry demand to the minister
that he refund the money instantly.</p>

<p>Se&ntilde;or Reverter declined to do so, saying that the country had need of
it, and upon his refusal the Bishop, without more ado, excommunicated
him.</p>

<p>Excommunication is a terrible punishment to inflict on any one. It means
that the sinner cannot enjoy any of the privileges of the Church, and
that he is forbidden all its comforts and blessings. Further than that,
it almost amounts to boycotting (see p. 998), for all churchmen who do
business with an excommunicated man, or serve him, are put under the ban
of the Church, and become outcasts with him. So that at one blow a man
loses friends and servants, and even has difficulty in getting food and
clothing.</p>

<p>It is said that the Pope was extremely angry with the bishop for having
taken such a serious step without first consulting him.</p>

<p>This power of the Church is very rarely exercised, and while a bishop
has the right to inflict this punishment on a member of his flock, he is
not supposed to do so without first consulting with the Pope, especially
when important personages are involved.</p>

<p>His Holiness was therefore most exasperated to find that the bishop of
Majorca had ventured on such a step without his permission. He has,
however, no ground for refusing to uphold the bishop, so the sen<a name="Page_1384" id="Page_1384"></a>tence
will have to stand, but it is rumored that he intends to show his
displeasure by removing the bishop to another diocese where the work
will be harder, and the income not so large.</p>

<p>Napoleon Bonaparte was excommunicated by Pope Pius VII. in 1809, but
since that time the punishment has hardly ever been inflicted, and it is
thought that at the present time, when Spain is in so much trouble, the
bishop should have sought some less severe measure to bring the minister
to terms.</p>

<p>It is of course a terrible thing for Spain that one of her highest
ministers should be so punished and disgraced.</p>

<p>It was hoped that Se&ntilde;or Reverter would resign his office, and so save
the Government any further trouble. This, however, he refuses to do, and
the members of his department are in sympathy with his defiance of the
Church.</p>

<p>It is said that friends are trying to persuade the bishop to forgive the
minister, and withdraw the sentence, if he consents to resign at the end
of the year.</p>

<p>The bishop is not willing to do anything of the kind. He thinks that if
the Government is allowed to plunder one church without punishment, all
the wealth belonging to the Church will soon be seized and taken
possession of by the crown.</p>

<p>This unfortunate affair has brought fresh trouble on poor Queen
Christina.</p>

<p>The Government, which has been in a very uncertain condition since the
death of Canovas, has been unable to oppose the excommunication of Se&ntilde;or
Reverter.<a name="Page_1385" id="Page_1385"></a></p>

<p>General Azcarraga, the Prime Minister, has offered his resignation to
the Queen, and asked her to form a fresh Cabinet. He says he is no
longer able to control the affairs of state.</p>

<p>This is the worst thing that could have happened at this moment. The
only man who seems fit to lead the Government is Se&ntilde;or Sagasta, but, as
we have told you before, he has very liberal views about Cuba.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="./images/15.png" alt="QUEEN CHRISTINA OF SPAIN." title="QUEEN CHRISTINA OF SPAIN." /></div>

<div class='center'>QUEEN CHRISTINA OF SPAIN.</div>

<p>If he comes into office there is little doubt but that he will recall
General Weyler, and offer home rule to the island, if he does not accept
our offer of arranging terms whereby Cuba can purchase the island for
herself.<a name="Page_1386" id="Page_1386"></a></p>

<p>While this policy is very pleasing to the friends of Cuba, the majority
of the Spaniards are unwilling to give up the island unless it is taken
from them by force.</p>

<p>Don Carlos knows this, and so has declared himself in favor of keeping
General Weyler where he is, and pressing the war still more severely
till the rebels are forced to give in.</p>

<p>The chances are that if Se&ntilde;or Sagasta comes to power there will be a
Carlist rising, and the young King Alphonse will lose his throne.</p>

<p>On the other hand, there seems to be no leader, strong enough to guide
the country, who believes in carrying out Canovas' policy, and as far as
the poor harassed Queen can see, the speedy subduing of Cuba is the only
policy that will please the people and keep her boy on the throne.</p>

<p>A number of Spanish war-ships have been sent to Cuban waters. It is said
that they are there to help moor the floating dock in some place of
safety until it can be brought into Havana Bay.</p>

<p>The dock, however, has not yet arrived in Cuba, and it is whispered that
the real object of the visit of these ships is to be in readiness in
case war is declared between the United States and Spain.</p>

<p>The Spaniards are very angry with us just now, and the Madrid papers
publish statements which assert that there is no possibility of avoiding
the war.</p>

<p>They think that we sympathize with the Cubans, and would be so glad to
see Cuba free that we are helping the insurgents to defy them.</p>

<p>They will not believe that General Woodford's mission to Spain is
peaceful and kindly meant. In <a name="Page_1387" id="Page_1387"></a>spite of the statement made by the Duke
of Tetuan about the friendliness of the meeting, the Madrid papers
insist that the United States sent an ultimatum to Spain, which means
that she sent a message, that either the war must be immediately brought
to a close, or we would fight her.</p>

<p>There are rumors that Austria will join with Spain, in case such a war
should break out. The Queen Regent was an Austrian princess before she
became Queen of Spain, and therefore the Spaniards think that Austria
would be certain to help them.</p>

<p>There is little foundation for all this wild talk. We do not want a war
with Spain, nor, for the matter of that, with any other nation. We would
prefer to live in peace with all men. We cannot, however, see the
struggle in Cuba without suffering grief and pain, and trying to do what
we can to bring it to an end.</p>

<p>Both President McKinley and President Cleveland were most careful to
keep on good terms with Spain, and the mission of General Woodford has
been undertaken with the desire of being helpful to both Cuba and Spain.</p>

<p>All our friendship for one party or the other cannot blind us to the
fact that Spain is losing ground in Cuba.</p>

<p>Despite our care, and the watchfulness of the gunboats stationed along
the coast, expeditions are constantly leaving our shores and taking
supplies to the rebels from their friends over here. The cause seems
stronger than ever, and it seems merely a waste of men and money to
prolong the struggle.</p>

<p>Our President, understanding this, and seeing how Spain is harassed in
other ways with the Carlists, <a name="Page_1388" id="Page_1388"></a>and the Government, and the war in the
Philippine Islands, thinks this is a good time to try and make peace.</p>

<p>It is quite sure that General Woodford has said nothing to anger Spain,
but it has not been thought advisable to publish the note which he
presented, and so it is not possible to tell you just what he did say.</p>

<p>It is supposed, however, that the note contained an offer to make peace
between the combatants on the ground of the purchase of Cuba by the
Cubans, the United States to guarantee the payment of the sum of money
agreed upon.</p>

<p>General Woodford has cabled to the State Department asking permission to
publish the contents of the note he gave the Duke of Tetuan.</p>

<p>The President is considering the matter, and will probably call a
Cabinet council to discuss it before anything is decided.</p>

<p>In the mean time, the Spanish are in such an excited state that the
Government of Spain fears for the safety of our minister. A special
guard was therefore ordered to accompany him from San Sebastian to
Madrid.</p>

<p>On his arrival at Madrid, the guard, which had travelled with him on the
train, again took him in charge, and conducted him safely to the
American legation.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that this angry feeling will soon subside, and that
the Spaniards may allow the United States to show that her only wish in
the matter of Cuba is to do what is just and right for all parties
concerned.</p>

<p>The resignation of the Spanish ministry will of <a name="Page_1389" id="Page_1389"></a>course delay the answer
to our letter, as it would be wrong for the Government to press for an
answer while affairs are so unsettled in Spain.</p>

<p>Austria has been having her share of excitement during the past week.</p>

<p>On the opening of the parliament in Vienna, a disgraceful scene was made
by the members of the lower house.</p>

<p>The session was to be opened by the Premier, Count Badeni. When he
entered the hall he was greeted with howls and hisses, and cries of
derision.</p>

<p>For certain reasons, which we will explain later, the Premier is at
present very unpopular with the parliament, and so the members greeted
him in this shameful manner, and finally one of the members, becoming
more excited than the others, advanced toward the Premier, and began
calling him names.</p>

<p>The result has been a duel between the member, Dr. Wolff, and the
Premier, and the occurrence has raised a storm throughout the country,
for that a Prime Minister should fight a duel with another member of the
Government is an unheard-of thing.</p>

<p>Austria is a very difficult nation to govern, and the position of
premier is by no means a bed of roses.</p>

<p>The reason of the difficulty is that Austria is composed of so many
different states which have very little in common with each other.</p>

<p>In all, there are three great divisions: the Austrians proper, who are
Germans in their leaning and language; the Hungarians, or Magyars, who
are a haughty, fierce people, speaking their own tongue, <a name="Page_1390" id="Page_1390"></a>proud of their
traditions, and who look down on the more modern Austrians as upstarts.
Besides these there are the Bohemians or Czechs (cheks), who speak still
another language, and are a wild and quickly irritated people,
obstinate, and as a rule slow-witted.</p>

<p>It is but natural that one or other of these people should be constantly
offended at the course of the Government, and see in every new law an
attempt to rob them of their rights and privileges.</p>

<p>The great trouble at present is the variety of the languages spoken. An
attempt has been made by the Government to enforce the speaking of
German throughout Austria. A law was passed making German the language
in which all official business must be carried on; but to make it
perfectly fair for the Hungarians and Bohemians as well as for the
Austrians, the law provided that all officers of the Government who were
stationed in districts where Czech or Magyar was spoken must be able to
speak these tongues as well as German.</p>

<p>This law is intensely unpopular.</p>

<p>The Austrians want one language throughout the country, and are
indignant at having to learn the Czech and Magyar, which are both
frightfully difficult; some people laughingly declare that Czech is as
hard to learn as Chinese. The Bohemians and Hungarians, on the other
hand, do not wish their languages to die out, and they think that it
would be only right to allow them to use their own tongue for official
business throughout Bohemia and Hungary.</p>

<p>They have become so violently opposed to the law, that they have been
making a great effort to revive their language, and have established a
literature of <a name="Page_1391" id="Page_1391"></a>their own, and are having the Czech language taught in
the schools. In Prague and many of the cities of Bohemia, no other
language is spoken.</p>

<p>Now Count Badeni, who has the difficult task of handling all these fiery
people, has got into disgrace all around.</p>

<p>The Austrians are angry with him because in a certain place, and for a
certain occasion, he allowed the Bohemians to use their own language for
official business. The Bohemians are angry with him for having forbidden
a certain public meeting; and others are again incensed against the
Prime Minister for having offended them in various, apparently
unimportant ways.</p>

<p>It was on account of his unpopularity and the various quarrels with him
that he was so badly treated by the members of the parliament, and was
finally so exasperated that he determined to fight a duel.</p>

<p>In Austria it is a criminal offence to fight a duel, and all the persons
engaged in an affair of the kind can be imprisoned for from one to five
years.</p>

<p>The Prime Minister, however, felt that he had been so terribly insulted
that nothing but a duel could satisfy his sense of honor.</p>

<p>He therefore telegraphed to the Emperor, asking his permission to fight.</p>

<p>Duelling used to be a very common practice in Europe, and was considered
the only means of avenging an insult. It was, however, carried to such
an extent, that men would call one another out, as it was termed, for
the most trifling offence. So many good and brave men were killed in
this unreasonable <a name="Page_1392" id="Page_1392"></a>manner, that one country after another began to make
laws forbidding the practice. These laws have only been in force for a
very few years, and in cases where men are terribly provoked, they still
turn to duelling as a means of settling their disputes.</p>

<p>The Emperor of Austria, when he learnt of the shameful things that had
been said to the Count, felt that, were he in the Premier's place,
nothing but a duel could satisfy his honor, and so he gave his
permission, and the duel took place.</p>

<p>Count Badeni was shot in the arm, and severely wounded; Dr. Wolff
escaped unhurt.</p>

<p>Immediately the duel had taken place the Premier's enemies seized upon
it as a means of disgracing him.</p>

<p>They raised a tumult about it, and declared that a man who would break
the law by fighting a duel was not fit to manage the affairs of
Government, and begged that the Count be dismissed from office, and
arrested.</p>

<p>The Premier was, however, well aware of the serious nature of the act he
contemplated, and that duelling was not a becoming occupation for a
Prime Minister, so, when he asked the Emperor's permission to fight, he
also sent in his resignation as Prime Minister.</p>

<p>The Emperor of Austria appears to be a very fair-minded man. Having
given his permission for the duel, he was not going to desert the Count.</p>

<p>He refused to accept the Count's resignation, and, as a reply to the
enemies of his Prime Minister, issued a decree forbidding the courts
from prosecuting the Count for breaking the law.</p>

<p>Such a decree would not do for us in America, <a name="Page_1393" id="Page_1393"></a>where the law is the
highest power in the state, and even the President is bound to obey it;
but in Austria, where such a thing was possible, it was certainly very
considerate of the Emperor to stand so bravely by his minister.</p>

<p>Duelling is also against the laws of the Church, and the Count might
have got into fresh trouble with his bishop if kind friends had not
helped him in this direction also.</p>

<p>His case was represented to the Pope, who also recognized that he had
been terribly tried and provoked, and graciously pardoned him.</p>

<p>Despite the efforts of his enemies, he has been able to make peace with
both his emperor and his bishop, and though he will not have a pleasant
time of it with such a parliament against him, he ought to be able to
overcome his difficulties with two such powerful friends behind him.</p>

<p>There was a delightful celebration the other afternoon in New York at
East River and Twenty-fourth Street.</p>

<p>It was the occasion of the opening of a new Recreation Pier, and the
children were out in force to take possession of their newly acquired
property.</p>

<p>When the present dock commissioners came into office they found an old
law on the books of the city which had never been put in force.</p>

<p>It provided that the dock commissioners could build an upper deck to any
of the piers which jutted out into the river, and arrange it for the use
of the people as a recreation pier, a place where the chil<a name="Page_1394" id="Page_1394"></a>dren could
walk and run and romp and play, and the mothers could take the babies
for a breath of fresh air on the summer nights, when their work was
done.</p>

<p>Finding the law on the books, these kindly men determined to carry it
out, and so they built the pier at the foot of Third Street; and, when
that was finished, began work on the one at East Twenty-fourth Street,
which was opened the other day.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="./images/24.png" alt="RECREATION PIER" title="RECREATION PIER" /></div>

<div class='center'>RECREATION PIER</div>

<p>There are to be five of these piers in all&mdash;two on the west side, and
three on the east.</p>

<p>The pier was opened by the Mayor, amid much merry music and general good
feeling.</p>

<p>At the head of the pier a wooden band-stand had been erected. This was
gaily decked with flags, and filled with chairs for the city fathers,
who were to come and make speeches and give the pier to the people.<a name="Page_1395" id="Page_1395"></a></p>

<p>Seats had been set aside for the children, and the little ones flocked
to them in hundreds, seeming to feel that this pier was for their
especial benefit. They crowded every entrance, eagerly waiting for the
moment when the city should give the new building to the people.</p>

<p>Presently the Mayor, Colonel O'Brien, and several others walked down the
pier. Colonel O'Brien is the chief of the dock commissioners who have
worked so faithfully to give the people this pleasure.</p>

<p>As the Mayor came down the aisle the little ones cheered and cheered,
and the big people joined them, and waved their handkerchiefs, and it
was quite an exciting moment.</p>

<p>Then the party mounted the decorated stand, and in a few pleasant words
the Mayor presented the gift of the city to the people.</p>

<p>He was followed by several other speakers, among them Mr. John Proctor
Clarke, who said some very nice things to the children.</p>

<p>He began by leaving the benches where the guests were seated, and
walking across the stand until he was as near to the children as
possible, for he said that what he had to say was intended for them, and
not for the grown-ups, and so he wanted them to hear him clearly.</p>

<p>"The Mayor," he said, "has given this pier to you; but do not think he
has given it as a charity. He has given it to me as well as to you, he
has given it to all the people who are here to-day, and all the people
in the city of New York, not as a charity to us, but because now that
the city has finished it, it belongs to us by right as citizens of this
town.<a name="Page_1396" id="Page_1396"></a></p>

<p>"The city has given us the use of this pier, and promises to keep it
swept and clean, and in good repair for us, but it is ours; we own it,
it belongs to us as citizens.</p>

<p>"Now what do we do with the things that belong to us? Do we throw them
away, or destroy them? We take care of them so that they may last, don't
we?</p>

<p>"Yes. Well, that's all I have to say to you about this pier. It is
yours. Take care of it."</p>

<p>The new pier is one of the largest of the five that are to surround the
city. It is roofed over, so that those who wish to enjoy it are
sheltered from the sun.</p>

<p>It is seven hundred and twenty feet long, and fifty feet wide. Plenty
large enough for crowds of people to use it in comfort.</p>

<p>The pier juts farther out into the river than any of the neighboring
docks, and at its end there is a fine view up and down the river.</p>

<p>Mayor Strong made a suggestion during the ceremonies that met with great
favor.</p>

<p>He said that he thought it would be a very nice thing to put glass sides
into the pier, and heat it. He thought it would make a grand hall for
the people of the district to use for meetings in winter, as well as
promenading in summer.</p>

<p>These five recreation piers are likely to prove a great blessing to the
city. The people who know most about such things have learned that to
keep boys and girls good they must be made happy. One of the easiest
ways to make them happy is to give them plenty of places where they can
romp and play in the fresh air and sunshine.</p>

<h2>INVENTION AND DISCOVERY.</h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Storm Front for Vehicles.</span>&mdash;For those who live in the country
and do much driving in the winter, this storm front is a capital scheme.</p>

<p>It is made on the same plan as the glass front of the new hansom cabs
which have been introduced into this country within the last few years.</p>

<p>The front is made in one solid piece. There are two little glass windows
in it, to enable the occupants of the buggy to see out. When it is not
in use it is pulled up over the heads of the riders, and when the storm
comes on a cord lets it down in front of them.</p>

<p>It is so adjusted that the driver can handle the reins under it, and
while it might not be safe to drive a skittish horse with it down, still
for the ordinary use in the country it will be a great comfort.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Combined Purse, Parcel-Carrier, and Buckle</span>.&mdash;This is an
ingenious device. Arranged in the form of a buckle for a waist-belt, it
answers the several purposes of purse, parcel-carrier, and buckle.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><a href="./images/27.png"><img src="./images/27-tb.png" alt="Purse, Buckle" title="Purse, Buckle" /></a></div>


<p>The picture you see represents the back of the <a name="Page_1398" id="Page_1398"></a>buckle; the front being
in the form of a pretty butterfly.</p>

<p>From the lower side of the clasp a strong hook is suspended. This hook
is a patent hook, opening to catch the strings of parcels, and snapping
tightly together again.</p>

<p>A little snap on the under side of one of the wings opens, and the body
of the butterfly turns back and reveals a neat little purse, large
enough for car fare or railroad tickets.</p>

<p>The buckle is principally intended for the use of bicyclists who need to
utilize every scrap of space, but for ordinary wear it is neat and
attractive as well as useful. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;G.H.R.</p>

<h2>FIRST PRIZE CONTEST.</h2>


<p>It has been difficult to separate carefully the best two lists from
among the two hundred and odd received in the <span class="smcap">First Prize
Competition</span>. However, a very careful canvass of them has been made,
and it has been found that as many as ten were complete lists.
Naturally, those who sent in first receive the prizes, and we are
pleased to announce that the first prize goes to Miss Marguerite
Metivier, Greenwood Ave., Waltham, Mass., and the second prize to Walter
L. Solomon, 344 West 145th Street. If they will write us their choice of
the prizes, we will send them immediately.</p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
